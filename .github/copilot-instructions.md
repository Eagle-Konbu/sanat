# GitHub Copilot Guidelines

This project uses GitHub Copilot as an AI coding assistant.

## Core Development Guidelines

**IMPORTANT**: You must follow all guidelines defined in [AI_GUIDELINES.md](../AI_GUIDELINES.md), including:

- **Commit Messages**: Write all commit messages in English following the Conventional Commits specification
- **Code Comments**: Minimize comments and focus on writing self-explanatory code. Only add comments to explain intent, not implementation
- **Philosophy**: Write code for humans to read, prioritizing clarity, simplicity, and maintainability

Please read AI_GUIDELINES.md carefully and adhere to all guidelines specified there.
